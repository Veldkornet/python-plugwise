# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

As spare-time/free-time developers we support this python module as best
as we can. We will support released versions as old as the module version
included in the `manifest.json` of the current and previous releases of
[Home Assistant Core](https://github.com/home-assistant/core) and/or
[`plugwise-beta`](https://github.com/plugwise/plugwise-beta)
(whichever used release is the oldest).

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Create an issue in this repository using the `bug` template. We're
frequent visitors of our own repositories and will try to provide a
solution as quick as we can. We are available on discourse using our
github aliases for quicker response, but always file an issue so other
users are also informed.

(Security) fixes will always be pre-released and released through
[`plugwise-beta`](https://github.com/plugwise/plugwise-beta) for
testing. A PR to HA Core will follow either in parallel or as soon as
possible.

Thanks in advance for helping us keeping the community safe.
